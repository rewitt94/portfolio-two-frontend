# Portfolio Two Frontend

### What is this project?

Before Makers Academy I was learning to program online. I was building this website as a my coding portfolio.

### React

I started learning React before I had a good notion of lots of basic programming principles. In fact, React's component model was actually my first introduction to encapsulation.To the horror of one of the coaches at Maker's Academy I used a React-type solution (instead of a JS Promise) to handle an asynchronous problem between a parent and child class. I defined a method on the child class within the parent class to change the state of the parent class (like passing a function through the props in React).

### Later Reflections

I have a strong conception of React's component model. However, with later reflection I don't think I have fully grasped the power of React. My JSX is quite repetitive and consequently I should probably be using Javascript to generate it.

### A Brief Index

I have written all of the CSS; No Bootstrap, no nothing. Not because my designs are better. Actually more out of bitter stubbornness than anything else. For the record, making web apps mobile friendly is hell. It is something for stronger people than myself - like single parents and war heroes. Mobile phones aside I really did enjoy the design process.

I've shortlisted my favourite projects for others to look at. Some of them are actually live. Please visit my website to be looped back to GitHub (while interest > 0).

At Maker's Academy we are taught to be language agnostic (but I may believe in Javascript). Here is a summary of the techs that I have encountered, but please remember I am extremely open to trying new languages!

Obviously a crucial part of portfolio website. Please have a go at the interactive CV as it makes my achievements sound much more interesting. This uses Redux to store your answers if you visit a separate component.
